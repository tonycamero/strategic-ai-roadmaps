# SECTION 2 — DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS
### Hayes Real Estate Group
### Strategic AI Infrastructure Roadmap

This section delivers a deep, cross-role analysis of Hayes Real Estate Group’s current operational state, based entirely on intake data and discovery call answers. It is structured to reveal systemic failures, root causes, and the precise constraints blocking scale.

---

# 2.1 LEAD FLOW DIAGNOSTIC

## Current State
Lead flow enters through Zillow, website forms, referrals, open houses, and agent personal networks. However:
- Lead intake is **inconsistent and unmonitored**.
- Weekend leads sit untouched until Monday.
- Assignment happens via **group text**—not a routing system.
- No unified tracking of source → response → conversion.

## Failure Patterns
- At least **20% of weekend leads never get a response**.
- No SLA enforcement.
- No automated intake sequences.
- Leads assigned randomly based on who responds first.
- Lost referral opportunities due to lack of structure.

## Root Causes
- CRM adoption < 20%.
- No automated routing rules.
- No centralized inbox.
- Owner and admin manually triage leads.

## Impact
- Estimated annual loss: $300K–$500K in missed deals.
- Brand inconsistency.
- Agents with high volume outperform only because of personal systems, not company systems.

# 2.2 SALES & CONVERSION DIAGNOSTIC

## Current State
Sales operations rely on individual agent behavior. The company has **no firmwide sales process**.

### Observed Breakdown Points
- Only **3 of 15 agents** use Follow Up Boss.
- No automated sequences for buyers, sellers, referrals, or cold leads.
- No tracking of response time, appointment rate, or lead aging.
- No documented cadence; each agent improvises.
- No measurement of conversion or fall-off.

## Behavioral Analysis
- Agents default to texting → zero visibility.
- Inconsistent pipeline hygiene.
- High dependence on top producers.
- Lack of coaching leverage because data doesn’t exist.

## Root Causes
- Complexity of FUB UI.
- No onboarding or training.
- No accountability system.
- No automation to support agents.

## Impact
- 5–10% lower conversion than market standards.
- Hard cap on agent capacity.
- Pipeline unpredictable for owner.

# 2.3 OPERATIONS & SYSTEMS DIAGNOSTIC

## Current State
Operations rely on a patchwork: Google Docs, Sheets, Dropbox, DocuSign, MLS, text threads.

### System Fragmentation
- MLS → CRM data copied manually.
- DocuSign signatures not reflected in deal status.
- Dropbox and Google Drive both store documents.
- Shared spreadsheets become out of sync.
- Reporting requires **3–4 hours weekly**.

## Workflow Failures
- No single source of truth.
- Multiple versions of key docs.
- Manual reconciliation for commissions.
- Data quality not owned by any role.

## Root Causes
- Tools chosen independently by agents.
- No integration layer.
- Ops director overloaded.
- No company-wide playbooks.

## Impact
- Significant administrative tax.
- Errors → delays → client dissatisfaction.
- No operational leverage for scaling.

# 2.4 SERVICE DELIVERY / FULFILLMENT DIAGNOSTIC

## Current State
The contract-to-close process is **highly manual and fragile**.

### Breakdown Points
- TC not notified for 2–3 days after offer acceptance.
- Inspection scheduling = phone tag.
- Document collection = chasing clients repeatedly.
- Clients ask agents for updates constantly.
- No client-facing status visibility.

## Client Experience Trends
Clients report:
- Confusion about next steps.
- Repeated document requests.
- Slow updates.
- Mixed service quality depending on agent.

## Root Causes
- No automated status triggers.
- No portal.
- No structured onboarding packets.
- No unified task system.

## Impact
- Longer contract timelines.
- Agent burnout.
- TC overcapacity.
- Reduced review scores and referral potential.

# 2.5 OWNER BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS

## Current State
Roberta is the final authority for:
- Pricing strategies
- Listing approvals
- Escalations
- Marketing copy review
- Tech/tool decisions
- Coaching

### Systemic Pattern
"If Roberta doesn’t approve it, it doesn’t move." This creates:
- Decision bottlenecks
- Slack in timelines
- Mental overload
- Inability to scale

## Root Causes
- No documented standards.
- No delegated authority.
- No SOP library.

## Impact
- All throughput limited by owner bandwidth.
- Owner burnout.
- Strategic priorities pushed aside for firefighting.

# 2.6 VOLUME STRESS TEST (2× TRANSACTIONS)

## At 2× Volume the Following Breaks:
### Lead Flow
- Unanswered leads double.
- Follow-up quality collapses.
- Assignment chaos worsens.

### Sales
- Top producers max out.
- Mid-level agents drop follow-ups entirely.

### Operations
- Document errors increase.
- Reporting becomes unmanageable.

### Delivery
- TC cannot handle increased load.
- Deadlines missed.
- Appraisal/inspection chaos.

### Owner
- Constant escalations.
- Zero strategic capacity.

## Summary
Hayes cannot scale under current conditions. The operational system is at or near capacity, with no leverage mechanisms in place. A new unified architecture is mandatory for growth.
