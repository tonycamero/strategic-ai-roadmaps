# SECTION 7 — OWNER DASHBOARD & METRICS
### Hayes Real Estate Group
### Strategic AI Infrastructure Roadmap

This section defines the **management system** Hayes will run on after implementing the new AI-driven operational architecture. It describes what Roberta sees daily, weekly, and quarterly — and how she uses these metrics to coach the team, optimize performance, and operate as a true CEO.

These are higher-level metrics used to adjust strategy.

# 7.6 HOW TO COACH USING THESE METRICS

## **1. When SLA Drops**
Ask:  
“Did we have coverage gaps?”  
Fix: adjust routing rules or add weekend automations.

## **2. When Follow-Up Compliance Drops**
Ask:  
“Do agents understand their daily GHL tasks?”  
Fix: Re-train daily task flow.

## **3. When Deal Velocity Slows**
Ask:  
“Where are deals stalling?”  
Fix: Improve workflows in that pipeline stage.

## **4. When Reviews Decline**
Ask:  
“Are clients confused or unupdated?”  
Fix: Enhance client portal visibility + automated status updates.
