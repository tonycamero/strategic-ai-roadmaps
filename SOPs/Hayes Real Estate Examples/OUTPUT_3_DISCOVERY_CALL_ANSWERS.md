## SECTION 1: LEAD MANAGEMENT & FOLLOW-UP

### Q1: Walk me through what happens when a new lead comes in right now. From the moment someone fills out a form or calls, what's the actual process?

**ROBERTA:** "Okay, so... it depends. If it's a web lead through Zillow or our website, it goes into Follow Up Boss—supposedly. But honestly, only three of our agents actually check it. Most of the time, someone on my admin team sees it and texts the agent group chat like 'Hey, who's taking this one?' Then it's whoever responds first, or I assign it if nobody jumps on it."

**MICHAEL:** "Yeah, and if it comes in on a weekend or after 6pm, it just... sits. Nobody's monitoring FUB on weekends. So Monday morning we're scrambling through all the weekend inquiries."

**SARAH:** "And if a lead comes to me directly—like a referral or someone I met at an open house—I'll text them back right away. But if they go through the 'system,' it's a coin flip. Could be 30 minutes, could be 8 hours."

**ROBERTA:** "The worst part is we have no idea how many we're missing. I'd guess at least 20% of weekend leads never get a response."

---

### Q2: You mentioned Follow Up Boss isn't being used consistently. What's the actual adoption rate, and why do you think agents aren't using it?

**ROBERTA:** "Three agents use it—Sarah, Jason, and maybe Kristen. That's it. Out of 15. The rest say it's 'too complicated' or 'takes too long.' They'd rather just text clients directly or use their personal CRM, which is usually... their phone notes app."

**SARAH:** "I use it because I have to track my pipeline, but even I'll admit—it's clunky. If I'm trying to log a call or update a status, I'm clicking through like five screens. So I get why newer agents don't bother."

**MICHAEL:** "And we've never really trained people on it. We bought it, gave everyone logins, and said 'figure it out.' So most people tried it once, got frustrated, and went back to texting."

**ROBERTA:** "I keep thinking we need better training, but honestly... I'm not sure the tool is the problem. It might just be the wrong tool for us."

---

### Q3: When a lead does get assigned to an agent, what's the follow-up cadence? Is there a standard sequence, or is it up to each agent?

**ROBERTA:** "It's 100% up to each agent. There's no standard. Some agents are amazing—Sarah will follow up five times in two weeks. Others send one text and then forget about it."

**SARAH:** "I have my own system. I'll text them day one, call day three, email day five, and then maybe check in again two weeks later. But that's just me. Nobody else does that."

**MICHAEL:** "We've tried to create a 'recommended cadence' but nobody follows it. And we can't enforce it because we don't have visibility into who's doing what."

**ROBERTA:** "So basically... if you get assigned to Sarah or one of our top three producers, you'll get great follow-up. If you get anyone else, it's a gamble."

---

### Q4: How do you currently measure lead response time and conversion rates?

**ROBERTA:** *(laughs)* "We don't. I mean, I can look at closed deals and see 'okay, we closed 85 transactions this year,' but I have no idea how many leads we actually got, how many we responded to, or how long it took."

**MICHAEL:** "We don't track response time at all. I couldn't tell you if we're averaging 2 hours or 8 hours."

**SARAH:** "And conversion is just... gut feel. I know my conversion rate is probably around 30%, but that's because I track it in a spreadsheet. The firm doesn't track it."

**ROBERTA:** "This is honestly one of my biggest blind spots. I know we're missing opportunities, but I can't quantify it. I just feel it."

---

## SECTION 2: SYSTEMS & TECHNOLOGY

### Q5: Beyond Follow Up Boss, what other tools are you using day-to-day?

**MICHAEL:** "Google Docs for everything—contracts, onboarding checklists, transaction timelines. We have a shared Dropbox for client files. Canva for marketing. Instagram for social. DocuSign for signatures. Slack for internal chat, but honestly most people still just text."

**ROBERTA:** "And then everyone has their own... ecosystem. Some agents use Trello, some use Notion, some use paper planners. It's a mess."

**SARAH:** "I use Calendly for scheduling, Loom for video messages, and HubSpot personally—but I pay for that myself because the firm doesn't have it."

---

### Q6: You mentioned transaction management is scattered across Google Docs and Dropbox. Can you describe a typical transaction lifecycle?

**MICHAEL:** "So once a deal goes under contract, David—our transaction coordinator—creates a Google Doc checklist. It's got like 40 line items: inspection, appraisal, title, disclosures, all that. He manually updates it as things get done."

**ROBERTA:** "But clients can't see it. So they're constantly texting the agent like 'What's the status?' and the agent has to ask David, who has to check the Doc."

**MICHAEL:** "And documents are all over the place. Some are in Dropbox, some are emailed, some are in DocuSign. If you want to find a signed disclosure, good luck—you're searching three places."

**SARAH:** "I have clients who've said 'This feels unprofessional.' And they're not wrong. For a $2 million home sale, we're managing it like a high school group project."

---

### Q7: What's the biggest friction point with your current tech stack?

**ROBERTA:** "Nothing talks to each other. Follow Up Boss doesn't talk to DocuSign. DocuSign doesn't talk to Dropbox. We're copying and pasting emails, manually updating spreadsheets, texting screenshots. It's insane."

**MICHAEL:** "And onboarding new agents is a nightmare because we have to give them logins to like 8 different tools, and half the time they don't use half of them."

**SARAH:** "For me, it's the lack of automation. I'm manually sending the same email 50 times a year. 'Hi [name], here's what to expect during escrow.' Why am I doing that in 2025?"

---

## SECTION 3: TEAM WORKFLOWS & BOTTLENECKS

### Q8: Michael, you mentioned in your intake that document collection is a mess. Can you walk me through what happens when you need, say, a client's proof of funds?

**MICHAEL:** "Oh god. Okay. So I'll email them: 'Hey, can you send proof of funds?' They'll reply with a photo of their bank statement taken on their phone. It's sideways, blurry, half-cut-off. I have to email back: 'Can you send a PDF from your bank?' Then they don't respond for three days. Then I have to follow up again. By the time I get it, we've blown past the deadline."

**ROBERTA:** "And multiply that by 10 documents per transaction, times 85 transactions a year. It's hundreds of hours of chasing."

**MICHAEL:** "The worst part is, I know exactly what documents I need on Day 1. But I can't just send them a secure link that says 'Upload these 8 things.' I have to manually email each request, track it in a spreadsheet, and follow up individually."

---

### Q9: Roberta, you mentioned everything bottlenecks through you. What decisions are you making that you wish you didn't have to?

**ROBERTA:** "All of them." *(laughs)* "But seriously—agents come to me for approval on listing photos, marketing copy, pricing strategy, client escalations, commission splits, tech issues... I'm approving Instagram captions. It's absurd."

**SARAH:** "To be fair, some of that is because we don't have clear guidelines. Like, I don't know if I'm allowed to offer a 2.5% commission or if it has to be 3%. So I ask Roberta."

**ROBERTA:** "Right. And I say yes every time, so why am I even in the loop? But we don't have documented policies, so people default to asking me."

**MICHAEL:** "Same with tech. If someone says 'Should we use this new tool?' they ask Roberta. But she doesn't have time to evaluate tools, so it just... doesn't happen."

---

### Q10: Sarah, you're the top producer—what would free up 10 hours a week for you?

**SARAH:** "Automated follow-up. If I could set up a sequence that sent texts, emails, and voicemails on autopilot—but still felt personal—that would save me 5 hours a week easily."

**SARAH:** "The other 5 hours? Transaction coordination. Right now, I'm basically co-managing every deal with David because clients text me, not him. If clients had a portal where they could see 'Here's your checklist, here's what's done, here's what's pending,' they'd stop bugging me."

**ROBERTA:** "And if Sarah had 10 extra hours, she could close 5 more deals a year. That's $500K in volume right there."

---

## SECTION 4: CLIENT EXPERIENCE & SERVICE DELIVERY

### Q11: What do clients complain about most?

**ROBERTA:** "Responsiveness. 'I texted my agent and didn't hear back for two days.' Or, 'I don't know what's happening with my deal—nobody's updating me.'"

**SARAH:** "And honestly, they're right. If you're not with a top-tier agent, the experience is hit-or-miss."

**MICHAEL:** "We also get complaints about the onboarding process feeling disorganized. Like, 'You asked me for this document three times,' or 'I don't know what I'm supposed to do next.'"

---

### Q12: What does a best-in-class client experience look like to you?

**ROBERTA:** "Instant response to inquiries—like within 5 minutes. Proactive updates throughout the transaction. A branded client portal where they can see everything in one place. Automated reminders so they don't miss deadlines. And post-close follow-up that keeps us top-of-mind for referrals."

**SARAH:** "I want clients to feel like they're working with a luxury brand. Right now, we're luxury-priced but not luxury-experience."

**MICHAEL:** "And I want them to never have to ask 'What's the status?' I want them to log in and see it."

---

## SECTION 5: GROWTH & SCALING

### Q13: You mentioned scaling to $100M. What has to change to get there?

**ROBERTA:** "We need to close 115 transactions instead of 85. That's 30 more deals. But I can't add 30 deals to this team without something breaking—probably David, or me."

**SARAH:** "We need better lead flow, better conversion, and better retention. If we could close 5% more of our leads, that's probably 15 deals right there."

**ROBERTA:** "And we need to stop leaking money. I'd bet we lose $500K a year in deals that fall through because of poor follow-up, missed deadlines, or clients who ghost us because we didn't stay on top of them."

---

### Q14: If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing tomorrow, what would it be?

**ROBERTA:** "Lead follow-up. If every lead got a response in 5 minutes, with a consistent follow-up sequence that ran automatically, I think we'd close 20% more deals."

**MICHAEL:** "Document collection. If clients could upload everything through a portal and we could track it in real-time, I'd get back 15 hours a week."

**SARAH:** "Transaction status visibility. If clients could see what's happening without asking me, I'd close more deals and have fewer fires to put out."

---

## SECTION 6: AI & AUTOMATION READINESS

### Q15: Where do you think AI could have the biggest impact on your business?

**ROBERTA:** "Lead qualification. Right now, I don't know if a lead is serious or tire-kicking until we've spent 2 hours on the phone with them. If AI could score leads and tell me 'This one's hot, this one's warm, this one's cold,' we'd prioritize way better."

**MICHAEL:** "Automated document requests. 'Hi [name], we need these 8 documents by Friday. Click here to upload them.' That would save me 10 hours a week."

**SARAH:** "Follow-up. If AI could send texts that sounded like me—'Hey [name], just checking in! Have you had a chance to think about that property?'—and only alert me when they respond, I'd never miss a lead."

**ROBERTA:** "And honestly... client communication. If AI could answer 80% of 'What's the status?' questions, that alone would be game-changing."

---

### Q16: What's your biggest concern about implementing AI?

**ROBERTA:** "That it feels robotic. Our clients expect a personal touch. If they get a generic AI email, they'll notice."

**SARAH:** "Same. I'm fine with AI doing the heavy lifting, but it has to sound like me. If it doesn't, it'll hurt my brand."

**MICHAEL:** "And honestly, I'm worried about adoption. If it's another tool that agents have to learn, they won't use it. It has to be dead simple."

---

## SECTION 7: FINAL PRIORITIES

### Q17: If we could only fix three things in the next 90 days, what should they be?

**ROBERTA:**  
1. **Lead response automation** – Every lead gets a text + email within 5 minutes, with a follow-up sequence that runs automatically.  
2. **Client status portal** – Clients can log in and see 'Here's where your deal is, here's what's pending, here's what's done.'  
3. **Document collection automation** – Clients upload docs through a portal, we get notified when they're submitted, and everything's tracked in one place.

**MICHAEL:** "I'd swap #3 for agent activity dashboards—so we can actually see who's following up and who's not."

**SARAH:** "I'd add lead scoring to the list. But honestly, if we nail those three, we're in a completely different business."
