- Build repeatable systems so business doesn't depend on Roberta personally
- Create predictable lead flow and conversion rates

**2. Biggest Frustration**

### Section B: Team & Workflow Health

**4. Where Work Gets Stuck**

### Section C: Systems & Communication

**7. Systems Struggles**
- CRM (Follow Up Boss): only 3 out of 15 agents use it properly
- Most communication via text and email outside system
- Transaction management is mess of Google Docs and Dropbox folders
- Marketing runs through Canva and Instagram with no tracking

**8. Communication Breakdown**
- Client follow-up completely inconsistent (minutes vs. days)
- Internal coordination relies on group texts that get buried
- Clients ask "what is happening with my deal" due to poor agent updates
- Referral partners complain about slow response times

**9. Manual Firefighting**
- Chasing agents for status updates
- Manually reviewing every listing before it goes live
- Responding to after-hours client emergencies
- Reconciling commission splits at month-end (broken tracking)

### Section D: Growth & Capacity

**10. Growth Barriers**
- Cannot scale without adding agents, but onboarding takes months of Roberta's time
- Lead quality unpredictable (flooded some months, desert others)
- No way to measure marketing ROI
- Agent turnover is costly and disruptive

**11. Breaking Point (if volume doubled)**
- Lead response time (already miss weekend/evening inquiries)

- Deals would fall apart
- Client service quality would tank (agents already stretched)

**12. AI Opportunities**

- Instant answers to common client questions
- Automated document collection and status updates
- Predictive analytics showing which leads most likely to close
