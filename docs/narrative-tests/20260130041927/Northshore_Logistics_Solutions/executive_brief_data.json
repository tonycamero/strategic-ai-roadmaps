We’re constantly stitching together info from different tools and conversations. The manual coordination overhead is too high.\n\nOperations relies on a mix of NetSuite for core financials and inventory, HubSpot for deal context coming from sales, Slack for day-to-day coordination, and spreadsheets for tracking job status, handoffs, and exceptions. Email is still used heavily for approvals and customer updates.\n\nLeads come in through referrals, outbound outreach, website forms, and events. A sales rep makes initial contact, qualifies the lead, and schedules a first call. After that, follow-up varies by rep. There’s no consistent next-step framework, and deals often stall unless someone actively pushes them.; Slow or inconsistent follow-up after the first call, unclear ownership for next steps, and lack of visibility into where deals actually stand. Prospects go cold or competitors move faster.\n\nAfter a contract is signed, details are handed off from sales to operations via email and Slack. Ops assigns the work and coordinates with delivery teams. Execution happens across multiple systems, and updates are shared manually. Projects complete, but visibility throughout the process is limited.; Slack for coordination, email for external communication, and spreadsheets for tracking milestones and exceptions. There’s no single project management system used consistently across teams.",
