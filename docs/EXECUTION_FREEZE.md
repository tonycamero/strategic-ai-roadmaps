# EXECUTION FREEZE

The following system layers are COMPLETE and FROZEN.

Any changes require explicit authorization and a contract-first proposal.

## Frozen
- H0 Opening Flow
- A1–A3 Intake Path
- R1 Reveal Moment
- Reveal Payload Contract
- Reveal UI Rendering
- CTA: generate_mini_roadmap
- CI Guard: TrustAgent Guard (GitHub Action)
- Enforcement: Canonical Compliance Guard (check_feta_canon_violation.ts)

## Rationale
These layers have been verified end-to-end:
Backend → Network → Frontend → UI

Regression here destroys momentum.
