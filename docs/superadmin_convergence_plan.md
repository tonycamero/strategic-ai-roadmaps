# SuperAdmin Convergence Plan — Phases 1-3 Execution Guide
**Status:** LOCKED & READY FOR EXECUTION  
**Date:** 2026-01-11  
**Objective:** Make SuperAdmin authoritative, safe, and deterministic

See artifact for full implementation details.

This plan addresses critical security gaps identified in the SuperAdmin Gap Analysis by implementing:
1. Backend authority enforcement with role-based middleware
2. Legacy UI deprecation with soft-disable and redirects  
3. Canonical roadmap finalization with readiness state management

**Execution Order:**
1. Phase 1: Backend Authorization (CRITICAL)
2. Phase 2: Legacy Detail Soft-Disable
3. Phase 3: Readiness + Canonical Finalize

**Northshore onboarding:** After Phase 1 merged (minimum), prefer after Phase 2.
