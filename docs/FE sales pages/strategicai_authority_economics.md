## What Are You Licensing?

You’re not buying resale rights. You’re stepping into infrastructure.

**You get:**
- A dedicated StrategicAI instance (branded to your ecosystem)
- Control over onboarding, certification, and content injection
- Access to SOP libraries, AI agents, and roadmap copilots
- Per-seat usage tied to your vertical, not the global pool

> This is your execution layer. Not a link. Not a widget.

## Where Does the Revenue Come From?

StrategicAI monetizes through 4 aligned revenue rails — all shared with you.

| Revenue Channel           | Example Yield                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **SMB SaaS License**      | $459/mo per SMB (split 50/50)             |
| **Strategic Roadmaps**    | $5,000+ per roadmap (split 50/50)         |
| **Execution Add-Ons**     | Optional SOP Packs, AI modules, diagnostics |
| **Enterprise Deployments**| Negotiated rev share on mid-market rollouts |

> This isn't a one-time launch model. It's recurring, usage-based, and extensible.

## How It Compounds

You’re not just selling into your audience. You’re building **a strategic asset**.

- **Every certified operator** becomes a monthly revenue node
- **Every active client** renews SaaS license (TrustConsole bundled)
- **Support load stays flat** (TrustConsole handles 80% of questions)
- **Your library (SOPs, tickets, playbooks)** compounds over time

This is **platform economics**, not coaching math.

> The longer you operate, the more your upside stacks — without proportional cost.

## What Does StrategicAI Keep?

We protect infrastructure. You own your brand.

- **Revenue Split:** 50/50 on net usage (after fees)
- **You Keep:** 100% of your list, audience, and curriculum IP
- **We Maintain:** The platform, AI models, TrustConsole, and core governance engine
- **Option:** Co-develop vertical templates, split proceeds (opt-in only)

> This is a shared-layer model. Aligned incentives. Zero friction.

## Bottom Line

You don’t need more funnels. You need **leverage that compounds.**

StrategicAI is not a tech partner. It’s the infrastructure beneath the next decade of transformation ecosystems.

**Use this lens only when they’re ready. Then slide it across the table.**
