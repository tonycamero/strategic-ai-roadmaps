# SITREP: 2026-01-24

**Status**: 🟡 RECOVERY / STABILIZATION
**Branch**: `recover/surgical-restore-20260124-173343`
**Head**: `5a1d863` (Fri Jan 23 22:00:29 2026) -> "Recover..."

## 1. Executive Summary

We are currently operating on **recovery terrain**. A "surgical restore" operation was performed at approximately **17:33** today, creating a new branch rooted in yesterday's stable state (`Jan 23`).

**Key Implication**: Any work performed earlier today (prior to 17:33) that was not merged to `main` appears to have been **discarded or shelved** to restore stability. We are effectively starting fresh from the Jan 23 baseline, with strictly governed improvements (API Constitution) now being layered on top.

## 4. Analysis & Comparison Notes

**(For comparison with your other GPT assistant)**

*   **Continuity Warning**: If the other assistant recalls doing work *today* (Jan 24), that work is **GONE** from this branch. We are strictly on the Jan 23 snapshot.
*   **Tactical Shift**: We have pivoted from "fixing" to "governing". Instead of chasing errors, we are defining the `SuperAdminApiContract` to force compilation determinism.
*   **Stability**: The environment is stable but incomplete. The type errors in SuperAdmin are consistent with the "Drift" identified in the new Constitution.

---

**Next Immediate Action**:
Proceed with implementing the `SuperAdminApiContract` (stubs) to resolve the drift and stabilize the frontend build.
