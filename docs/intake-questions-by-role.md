## Role Mapping for Chamber Organizations

The system maps platform roles to Chamber-specific metadata roles:

| Platform Role | Chamber Role |
|--------------|--------------|
| Owner | Chamber Executive |
| Operations | Membership Director |
| Sales | Community Engagement Lead |
| Delivery | Programs & Events Lead |

---

## Question Bank Structure

All Chamber-specific questions are defined in `frontend/src/intake/chamberQuestionBank.ts` with the following structure:

```typescript
type QuestionDef = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
};

const chamberQuestionBank: Record<ChamberRole, QuestionDef[]> = {
  chamber_executive: [...],
  membership_director: [...],
  community_engagement_lead: [...],
  programs_events_lead: [...]
};
```

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Business Type Detection**: The system uses `businessType === 'chamber'` to determine which question set to display
- **Conditional Rendering**: Chamber-specific questions are only shown when `isChamber` is true
- **Role Metadata**: Chamber roles are stored in the `chamberRole` field but do not change the underlying `UserRole` values
- **Backward Compatibility**: All intake forms support both new submissions and updates to existing responses
- **Validation**: All questions marked as `required` must be answered before submission
