# META-TICKET: EXEC-BRIEF-CANONICAL-CONTRACT-PREEMPT-001
## Pre-emptive Canonical Contract for Executive Brief Generation (AG Alignment Gate)

**STATUS: ACCEPTED / ACTIVE**

### OBJECTIVE
Establish a non-negotiable canonical contract that governs how Executive Briefs are conceptually produced, transformed, and assembled by AG — BEFORE any further narrative logic, PDF changes, or UI wiring occurs.

### 1. FIVE-LAYER SYNTHESIS MODEL (CONFORMANT)
The Executive Brief is a **Delivery Artifact**, produced via these distinct layers:

1. **FACT LAYER**: Raw intake/vector data. Immutable facts. No interpretation.
2. **PATTERN LAYER**: Named patterns (Constraint, Risk, Leverage). No prose.
3. **ASSERTION LAYER**: Deterministic production of **Executive Assertion Blocks (EABs)**.
4. **SECTION ASSEMBLY LAYER**: Ordering of EABs into locked sections. No rearrangement.
5. **PRESENTATION LAYER**: Final formatting (PDF/UI). Zero semantic changes.

### 2. ROLE SEPARATION (CONFORMANT)
Processing is strictly isolated between these logical roles:

- **ROLE: Fact Extractor**: Source data extraction only.
- **ROLE: Pattern Synthesizer**: Pattern naming/identification only.
- **ROLE: Executive Asserter**: Production of declarative, falsifiable assertions.
- **ROLE: Assembler**: Structural ordering only.
- **ROLE: Renderer**: Pure formatting with no logic.

### 3. EXECUTIVE ASSERTION BLOCK (EAB) SPECIFICATION
The **Executive Assertion Block** is the semantic center of gravity.
- **Assertion**: $\le$ 24 words, present tense, declarative.
- **Evidence**: 1–3 compressed signals, no quotes, mapped to source.
- **Implication**: Executive cost (time/risk/capital/attention), $\le$ 2 sentences.
- **Constraint Signal**: Structural root causes only.
- **Alignment (Internal)**: Influences inclusion and ordering; never rendered as a section.

### 4. LOCKED SECTION CONTRACT
Assembled in this specific order:
1. **Executive Assertion Block** (Required)
2. **Strategic Signal Summary** (Derived)
3. **Top Risks** (Max 5 EABs)
4. **Leverage Moves** (Max 5 EABs)
5. **Operating Context Notes** (Optional, Bounded)

### 5. FAILURE SEMANTICS
- Reject EABs if required fields cannot be generated truthfully.
- Abort generation if total valid EABs < 3 (Insufficient Signal).
- No narrative padding or ad-hoc sections.

### AG CONFIRMATION
I, Antigravity, explicitly acknowledge and accept the five-layer model, the hard role separation, and the Executive Assertion Block as the semantic center of gravity for all future Executive Brief work. No future ticket will violate this contract without explicit override.
