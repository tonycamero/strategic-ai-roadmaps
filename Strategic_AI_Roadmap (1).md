# Summary

### Current State
Hayes Real Estate Group is a real estate firm currently struggling with inconsistent lead follow-up, scattered systems, and a lack of process automation.

### Critical Pain Points
- Inconsistent use of CRM leading to poor lead response times, especially on weekends.
- Lack of standard follow-up cadence resulting in missed opportunities.
- Disparate tech tools causing inefficiencies and communication breakdowns.
- Owner and top producer bottlenecks due to lack of clear policies and automated systems.

### Proposed Transformation
We are building a unified, AI-enhanced operational framework to streamline lead management, improve client experience, and empower the sales team with actionable insights.

### 12-Month Outcome
Success will be measured by a reduction in lead response time to under 5 minutes, a 20% increase in deal closures through automated follow-up, and a seamless client experience with real-time transaction visibility.
