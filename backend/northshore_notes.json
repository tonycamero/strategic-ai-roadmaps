    "notes": "{\"sessionMetadata\":{\"date\":\"2026-01-22\",\"duration\":\"\",\"attendees\":\"\",\"firmName\":\"\"},\"currentBusinessReality\":\"Team size is approximately 146 people total. Rough breakdown is about 90 in operations and warehouse staff, 25 drivers, 12 in sales and account management, 10 in admin/finance/HR, and a small IT/ops systems team of around 4 people. Owner and COO are still directly involved in day-to-day operations and approvals.\\n\\nLead volume averages around 40 new leads per month. This includes inbound website inquiries, referrals from existing clients, and broker introductions. Of those, roughly 10–15 convert into active deals or contracts in a given month, depending on capacity and seasonality.\\n\\nEffectiveness of lead assignment and follow-up is measured mostly through manual reporting. Sales managers review HubSpot dashboards weekly, but follow-up compliance is inconsistent. There is no automated SLA enforcement, and missed or delayed follow-ups are usually discovered after a lead goes cold.\\n\\nSales to operations handoff currently happens through a mix of CRM notes, email threads, and shared Google Docs. Once a deal is marked “closed-won,” sales fills out an internal intake form, which is emailed to operations and sometimes re-entered into NetSuite. This handoff is one of the most error-prone parts of the process.\\n\\nCRM data consistency is a recurring issue. Fields are often incomplete or overwritten, deal stages are not updated consistently, and there are frequent mismatches between what sales reports in HubSpot and what operations sees in NetSuite. Duplicate records and outdated contact information are common.\\n\\nExceptions in fulfillment are handled ad hoc. When something goes wrong (missed delivery, warehouse delay, inventory discrepancy), operations escalates via Slack or email. There is no standardized exception workflow, tracking system, or root-cause logging. Resolution depends heavily on who notices the issue first.\\n\\nDecision-making delays usually come from unclear ownership and approval bottlenecks. Pricing exceptions, capacity adjustments, and contract changes often require owner or COO sign-off, which can slow deals or operational changes by days.\\n\\nThe owner believes automation could significantly reduce their bottleneck by handling routine approvals, surfacing exceptions earlier, and providing better real-time visibility into operations and sales performance without manual reporting.\\n\\nCustomer satisfaction is tracked informally. Account managers collect feedback during check-ins, but there is no consistent NPS or CSAT program post-onboarding. Issues are typically identified only when a client complains or threatens to churn.\\n\\nData discrepancies between NetSuite and HubSpot occur weekly. Common issues include mismatched deal values, missing service details, and timing differences between when deals close and when operations starts execution.\\n\\nSeveral manual tasks were identified as strong candidates for automation, including lead routing, follow-up reminders, sales-to-ops handoff documentation, exception reporting, and recurring operational reports.\\n\\nCurrent resource constraints include limited IT capacity, overextended operations managers, and warehouse staffing shortages during peak periods. These constraints make it difficult to scale without better systems and automation.\\n\\nStrategic initiatives are prioritized reactively. Leadership focuses on the most urgent operational fires rather than longer-term improvements. There is no formal prioritization framework tying initiatives to ROI or capacity impact.\\n\\nLeadership would like to see meaningful improvements within the next 60–90 days, especially around lead follow-up speed, handoff accuracy, and operational visibility.\\n\\nNo major new tools have been selected yet, but the team is considering workflow automation tools and deeper CRM/ERP integration to reduce manual work and data inconsistencies.\",\"primaryFrictionPoints\":\"\",\"desiredFutureState\":\"\",\"technicalOperationalEnvironment\":\"\",\"explicitClientConstraints\":\"\"}",
