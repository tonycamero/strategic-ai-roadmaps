This brief reflects how the business is operating in practice, not how it appears in plans, tools, or reporting. It is grounded in intake from leadership and operating roles, and focuses on how work actually moves through the organization: where decisions are still manual, where coordination depends on experience, and where attention is being consumed day to day.

This is not a performance evaluation and it is not a set of recommendations. It is a synthesized mirror of operating reality, designed to establish shared clarity before judgment or prioritization. Some observations will feel familiar. Others may name patterns that are usually carried tacitly rather than stated directly.

Read the sections as one system, not as standalone verdicts. The value of the brief is alignment on what is true now, so the next decisions are grounded in a common understanding of how the business is actually functioning.
