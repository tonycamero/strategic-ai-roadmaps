Role: owner
  Priorities: Stop missing calls and opportunities we’re already paying for

Get out of daily dispatch and problem-solving

Grow revenue without adding more office staff or chaos
  Frustration: I don’t trust that every call or lead is being handled properly. We’re busy, but it feels reactive. I’m constantly pulled in to fix scheduling issues, answer questions, or deal with problems I find out about too late. There’s no clear picture of how the day actually went unless something breaks.
  Bottlenecks: Dispatch and admin are stretched thin, especially during busy days or after hours. I also end up being a bottleneck because decisions come back to me when things aren’t clear.
  Barriers: Operational chaos. I don’t feel confident increasing volume because I know the cracks will widen — missed calls, poor follow-up, and scheduling issues.
