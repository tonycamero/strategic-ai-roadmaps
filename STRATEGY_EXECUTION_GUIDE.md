# STRATEGY OVERVIEW & EXECUTION GUIDE

### *Outbound Acquisition → Roadmap Production → Pilot Delivery → Implementation Ops*

---

## I. STRATEGIC NORTH STAR

Tony is not selling "AI tools."
You are selling **team performance infrastructure.**

Everything in this guide is designed to support one unifying promise:

> **"We install the systems that let your team operate like the top 1%."**

Outbound messaging, Roadmap structure, and Implementation Ops all reinforce this.

---

## II. OUTBOUND STRATEGY (The 20 → 10 Funnel)

### 1. Target Segments

Professional service firms with 4–50 employees:

* CPAs & tax firms
* Insurance & financial advisory
* Law firms
* Boutique agencies
* Consulting firms
* Real estate brokerages with teams

**What they share:**
Delivery complexity, communication gaps, pipeline inconsistency, lack of systemization.

They feel the Team Performance Crisis immediately.

---

### 2. Core Messaging Pillars (Outbound)

#### A. "2025 is the separation year."

Teams that adopt executive-level AI systems will outperform peers dramatically.

#### B. "Your bottleneck isn't tools — it's team execution."

Tools don't fix chaos; systems do.

#### C. "We build your Executive AI Layer."

Role-based AI infrastructure → team acceleration.

#### D. "20 Roadmaps → 10 Pilots."

Clear scarcity + structure.

---

### 3. The Outbound Execution System

#### A. Research → Build Target Lists

Use:

* LinkedIn Sales Navigator
* Local business directories
* Chamber membership lists
* Google Reviews (service firms with 4–50 staff)

Fields to capture:

* Firm name
* Owner/Principal
* Website
* Industry
* Team size
* Services
* Messaging tone
* Current CRM (if identifiable)
* Signs of complexity (reviews, service mix, careers page)

---

#### B. Outbound Sequence (Maria + Tony)

**Email 1 (Maria) — "20 Firms, No-Cost Roadmap"**

Short. Direct. Professional.

**Goal:** Awareness + raise hand.

**Email 2 (Maria) — "Team Performance Crisis"**

Diagnostic framing:

* "Your people are your bottleneck, not your software."

**Goal:** Emotional resonance.

**Tony Cold Call Script**

Purpose: only one objective → schedule the 30-minute Research Call.

**Script skeleton:**

* "Quick call — I'm Tony with Tony."
* "We're selecting 20 firms in Eugene for a no-cost Strategic AI Roadmap."
* "It's for teams looking to eliminate chaos, clean up workflow, and accelerate performance."
* "Can we get 30 minutes on the calendar?"

---

### 4. The Research Call (The Clarity Call)

#### Goal:

Collect raw materials to build a jaw-dropping Roadmap.

#### Focus Areas:

* Current workflow
* Pipeline handoffs
* Team size/roles
* Bottlenecks
* Chaos points
* Errors
* Bottleneck person(s)
* CRM + PM tools
* Meeting cadence
* Content/communication habits
* Where money falls through cracks

#### Deliverables captured:

* 3–5 quotes
* 5–7 bottlenecks
* 3 efficiency gaps
* 2–3 revenue leaks
* 2 capacity limits

These become the spine of the roadmap.

---

## III. ROADMAP CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM (Your 90-Min Deliverable Machine)

This is where you create your $1,500 value in a single working session.

### 1. Structure of the Roadmap (5 Sections)

#### Section 1 — Executive Summary (1 paragraph)

Define the firm's Team Performance Profile:

* What's working
* What's breaking
* Why they're hitting a ceiling

#### Section 2 — Diagnostic (Current State)

Show:

* Chaos loops
* Communication drag
* Consistency leaks
* Execution bottlenecks

**Key: use THEIR words back to them.**

#### Section 3 — Opportunity Map (The Unlocks)

Show:

* Time savings
* Team acceleration
* Coordination improvements
* Revenue unlock points
* Meetings → execution

#### Section 4 — The Solution: Executive AI Layer

Explain:

* Role-based GPTs
* Unified Memory Layer
* Meeting Intelligence
* Workflow Automation
* CRM cleanup

#### Section 5 — Your 90-Day Plan

Broken into:

* 30-day sprint (Pilot)
* 30-day scaling
* 30-day optimization

**Ends with:**
"Your team can operate like a top-tier firm in 90 days."

---

## IV. PILOT IMPLEMENTATION OPS ($5K Build-Sprint)

This is where your operations *must* be clean to deliver consistently.

### 1. The 30-Day Sprint Structure

#### Week 1 — Foundation

* Build Firm Tone Blueprint
* Map team roles
* Identify 3–5 highest-impact workflows
* Install AI Org Memory (mini version)

#### Week 2 — Workflow & Comms Layer

* Automated follow-ups
* Meeting intelligence
* Clean handoff architecture
* Priority pipelines

#### Week 3 — Role-Based CustomGPTs (3–5 roles)

* ExecutiveGPT
* OpsGPT
* SalesGPT
* ServiceGPT
* MarketingGPT

#### Week 4 — Installation + QA

* Team training
* Testing
* Revisions
* Rollout
* Success measurement

---

## V. EXPANSION: AI ORG CHART™ (Premium Tier)

After the pilot, you sell the full build-out:

### Components:

* 5–12 role GPTs
* Brain Clones for leaders & key staff
* Unified Memory Layer
* Full CRM architecture
* AI-driven internal comms
* Cross-role workflow alignment

This becomes their **firm operating system**.

---

## VI. IMPLEMENTATION OPS: HOW YOUR TEAM EXECUTES

You need 3 lanes internally:

---

### Lane 1 — Outbound & Growth (Tony + Maria)

Responsibilities:

* Target list building
* Sequence management
* Research Calls
* Closing Pilot
* Maintaining Eugene relationships

KPIs:

* Booked calls
* Conversion to Roadmap
* Conversion to Pilot
* Pilot → Org Chart upsell

---

### Lane 2 — Roadmap Production (You + 1 Ops Analyst)

Responsibilities:

* Intake
* Diagnostic
* Roadmap composition
* Success narrative
* 90-day plan drafting

Tools:

* Templates
* Call transcript GPT
* Insight extraction tools
* Roadmap writer GPT

---

### Lane 3 — Implementation Ops (Tech + System Builder)

Responsibilities:

* CRM architecture
* CustomGPT development
* Tone blueprints
* SOP digitization
* Unified Memory
* Training delivery

KPIs:

* Days-to-Deployment
* Client adoption
* Reduction in chaos points
* Time saved (validated)

---

## VII. LEAD GENERATION PIPELINE

You should run 3 channels:

### 1. Outbound (Primary)

Local Eugene → 20→10 funnel.

### 2. "AI Team Performance" Workshops

Host monthly, local.

### 3. Whitepaper: "The Team Performance Crisis"

This becomes a **lead magnet**.

---

## VIII. METRICS THAT MATTER

### Outbound:

* 200 firms researched
* 20 Roadmaps
* 10 Pilots
* 30–50% expansion into AI Org Chart

### Ops:

* Pilot delivery in 30 days
* 3–6 CustomGPTs deployed
* 90-day transformation

### Performance (client side):

* Meetings → execution (before/after)
* Response times
* Handoff failures
* Time saved

---

## IX. DELIVERABLES & NEXT STEPS

### Core Documents Created:

✅ **WHITEPAPER_AI_ORG_CHART.md** — Category-defining thought leadership

## XI. RISK MITIGATION

### Delivery Risk:
- **Mitigation:** Roadmap template + standardized diagnostic framework
- **Backup:** Ops analyst to support high-volume weeks

### Conversion Risk:
- **Mitigation:** 20→10 funnel has built-in buffer (200 firms researched)
- **Backup:** Extend outbound if conversion rates <50%

### Implementation Risk:
- **Mitigation:** 30-day sprint structure with weekly checkpoints
- **Backup:** Tech resource on-call for CustomGPT development

### Capacity Risk:
- **Mitigation:** Stagger Pilot starts (2-3 per week max)
- **Backup:** Extend timeline or bring in contractor support
