# 4-Week Outbound Sprint — Eugene Launch
## AI Org Chart™ Platform + Services Integration

**Mission:** Fill 20 Strategic AI Roadmaps + Pre-sell 10 January Pilots in 4 weeks.

---

## The Platform Integration Story

### What The Team Needs to Know

The **AI Org Chart™ Platform** is not a separate product — it's **the delivery mechanism** for everything we're selling.

**In practice:**

- **Outbound** sells the Roadmap & Pilot
- **Roadmap** defines the first wave of AI teammates/workflows
- **Pilot Implementation** is now delivered *through this platform*, not ad hoc builds
- **Full Org Chart / Retainers** = "turn on more modules in the platform + add roles"

**For clients, this means:**

When we say "AI Org Chart," they're getting:
- An **Org Chart view** of their AI teammates (ExecutiveGPT, SalesGPT, etc.)
- A **Metrics Dashboard** showing usage, time saved, and adoption
- A **Firm Memory Library** where their SOPs/templates live and fuel the AI
- All AI chats, automations, and usage on **one canvas** instead of scattered CustomGPTs

**So your services are the wrapper; this SaaS is the engine.**

---

## Sales Narrative Integration

### For Outbound (Tony + Maria)

**What you're selling:**

Not "we'll hook up some AI tools."

But:

> "You'll get your own AI Team Dashboard where we map your ExecutiveGPT, SalesGPT, ServiceGPT, and show you exactly how they're performing."

**In calls, you can literally say:**

- "In the Pilot, we stand up your firm's Org Chart in the AI Org Chart™ Platform."
- "You'll have a dashboard to see where AI is actually saving your team time."
- "This isn't consulting theater — you'll log into a real system that manages your AI teammates."

**Architecture → sales narrative asset.**

---

### For Roadmap Construction

When you run the **Strategic AI Roadmap** for a firm, your outputs map directly to the platform schema:

**Roadmap Section** → **Platform Component**
- Org structure & roles → `ai_teammates` table (ExecutiveGPT, SalesGPT, ServiceGPT…)
- Key people → `users` + `brain_clones`
- SOPs / templates / policies → `firm_memory_documents`
- Usage assumptions & time savings → `performance_metrics` baseline + targets
- Candidate workflows → `workflows` (Phase 2)

**Add this section to every Roadmap:**

> ### Your AI Org Chart™ Implementation
> 
> **Phase 1 (Pilot - Week 1-4):**
> - AI Teammates we'll stand up: ExecutiveGPT, SalesGPT, OperationsGPT
> - Firm Memory we'll centralize: SOPs, templates, proposal library
> - Initial metrics tracking: usage, time saved, adoption
> 
> **Phase 2 (Full Org Chart - Month 2-3):**
> - Additional teammates: ServiceGPT, MarketingGPT, FinanceGPT
> - Brain Clones for [Owner Name], [Key Manager Name]
> - Workflow automation: meeting summaries, proposal generation, follow-ups
> 
> **Phase 3 (Optimization - Ongoing):**
> - Monthly performance reviews
> - Continuous prompt refinement
> - New workflow development
> - Team training & adoption support

This ties the **consulting deliverable** directly into the **platform architecture**.

## 1️⃣ Targets & Math

**Goal by end of 4 weeks:**

- ✅ **20 Strategic AI Roadmaps** booked & delivered (or scheduled)
- ✅ **10 x $5K Pilots** verbally committed + start dates locked for January

**Working funnel (conservative):**

- 100–150 target firms in Eugene + region
- ~40–60 conversations (email/phone/LinkedIn)
- ~25–30 30-min Research Calls booked
- 20 completed Roadmaps
- 10 pilots closed for January

**Revenue Impact:**
- 10 Pilots @ $5K = **$50K** (January-February service revenue)
- Platform fees (10 clients @ $750/mo) = **$7,500/mo** recurring
- Year 1 from this cohort: **$50K + $90K ARR = $140K**

---

## 2️⃣ Weekly Plan — 4-Week Outbound Sprint

### Week 1 — Set the Table & Start Conversations

**Objectives:**
- Finalize offer assets

  - "This is your firm memory library"
- [ ] Use architecture doc visuals to explain the system

**Messaging:**

- "We're closing the Pilot cohort soon so we can do capacity planning."

## 4️⃣ Platform-Specific Value Props for Sales

## 9️⃣ Risk Mitigation

### Outbound Risks

**Risk:** Low response rates  
**Mitigation:** A/B test email subject lines, try different messaging angles, increase LinkedIn touchpoints

**Risk:** Research Calls don't convert to Roadmaps  
**Mitigation:** Refine Research Call script, ensure capturing enough diagnostic data, improve Roadmap template quality

**Risk:** Roadmaps don't convert to Pilots  
**Mitigation:** Stronger value demonstration, show platform mockups, create urgency with cohort scarcity

### Delivery Risks

**Risk:** Platform MVP not ready for January  
**Mitigation:** Define absolute minimum viable scope, have manual backup plan (Google Sheets + ChatGPT access), communicate clearly with clients about "beta" status

**Risk:** Can't deliver 10 Pilots simultaneously  
**Mitigation:** Stagger start dates (2-3 per week), standardize setup process, create detailed runbooks

**Risk:** Clients don't adopt platform  
**Mitigation:** Mandatory kick-off training, weekly check-ins first month, gamify usage, tie success to their visible metrics
